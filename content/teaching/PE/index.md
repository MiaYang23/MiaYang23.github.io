This course offers an in-depth exploration of key private equity topics, focusing on buyout market financial and governance issues, and the relationship between PE fund investors and managers.

It begins with a discussion from a “macro” perspective, using the "Yale University Investment Office" case to highlight PE's role in the broader investment landscape. The course then turn to the “micro” perspective and spend a substantial part of the course studying various aspects of buyout transactions and deal-making in detail covering how buyout funds evaluate, structure, manage, and exit investments.

Finally, it examines private equity from an institutional investor's perspective, including fund structure, incentive alignment, and strategies for PE managers, along with alternative PE investment approaches.
