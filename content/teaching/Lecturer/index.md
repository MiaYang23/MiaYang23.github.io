Decisions about mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are among some of the most important decisions for firms. This course covers M&A from a financial perspective.

The course is entirely case-based. Topics related to M&A and corporate governance will be covered. This includes issues related to corporate financial markets (debt and equity), deal structures, financial regulation (in Sweden, the US and across other key jurisdictions) and negotiations.
