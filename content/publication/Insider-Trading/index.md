abstract: "This paper investigates how tightening insider trading regulations impacts the governance roles of blockholders. Using the 2016 implementation of the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) as a quasi-natural experiment, we analyze how heightened disclosure requirements alter the composition and behavior of key shareholders. Our findings reveal that short-term (liquidity-focused) investors reduce their board representation in the aftermath of stricter insider trading rules, while their presence on nomination committees was unchanged. MAR also increased short-term blockholders’ probability of board exit by 16-20 percentage points. By quantifying the shift in monitoring intensity versus trading flexibility, we shed new light on the trade-off between governance benefits and liquidity constraints."
