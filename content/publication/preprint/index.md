abstract: This paper investigates the involvement of various types of major shareholders in board governance and their impact on board governance within the Swedish model of Nomination Committees (NC), where the largest shareholders directly nominate board directors. The findings identify several factors that hinder in- vestor participation in governance-the need for liquidity, limited resources, and insufficient knowledge of the Swedish model. By comparing firms with newly es- tablished shareholder-composed NCs to those with NCs formed before 2008, the study concludes that the direct involvement of shareholders in director elections enhances board governance.
